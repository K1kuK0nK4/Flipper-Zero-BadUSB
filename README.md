# Flipper-Zero-BadUSB

Flipper Zero BadUSB payloads for relaying data to a Discord webhook.

## About

This repository contains a collection of payloads for the Flipper Zero, USB Rubber Ducky or similar devices. The provided script `Hostname2Disc.txt` serves as a foundational template for various payloads.

## Disclaimer

All these payloads are designed for educational, testing, and research purposes in cybersecurity.

I am not a professional in PowerShell scripting. I am using this project to learn about DuckyScripting and its capabilities with Flipper Zero. 

Feel free to fork and contribute to the community.

## Usage

he concept of executing the PowerShell payload in base64 was inspired by the project at https://github.com/InfoSecREDD/REPG.
